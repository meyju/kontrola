# kontrola

_/kɔnˈtrɔ.la/ - inspection (the act of examining something, often closely) [Polish]_ (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pl-kontrola.ogg?embedplayer=yes">audio</a>)

A script that uses nmap to sweep a subnet looking for ports with SSL certs, then querying those certs to discover upcoming expiration dates. Besides discovery, it can also do more traditional tracking using a host based file that you provide. See usage for an example configuration.

## Motivation

There are plenty of scripts out there that will check SSL/TLS certificates and let you know when they're due for renewal, but none (that I've found) that can optionally sweep a subnet, finding live hosts with ports presenting SSL certifcates, and then querying those certificates for their expiration dates, and finally displaying themm in a easy to read manner online.

## Features

* scans a static list of hosts for SSL certificate expiration dates (default)
* bulids a simple, easy to read report in html using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), listing all Expired, Expiring, and Valid certifcate dates
* (optional) uses [nmap](https://nmap.org) to discover live hosts on a subnet, either the on the script is running on, or a targeted one
* (optional) pokes at live hosts, checking known TLS/SSL ports to see if they are available

## Report screenshots

The html report is built using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), written to the `html/` directory by default, and is straightforward in its presentation

## Usage

* Checkout the code

```
git clone https://github.com/philcryer/kontrola.git
cd kontrola
```

### Host list mode (default)

* Edit any varables in the script, if desired
* Edit the `domains.txt` file, adding domains you want be checked
* Run the script

```
./kontrola
```

to run with an other list, use:

```
static_file="domains.txt.project_name" ./kontrola
```

Check the `html/` directory for the output report

### Portscan mode

* Run the script, with discovery turned on
* By default it will seach the `/32` of the subnet the host is running on

```
discovery="yes" ./kontrola
```

* Optionally you can list a subnet target for it to sweep

```
discovery="yes" discovery_subnet="10.10.0.0/32" ./kontrola
```

## Todo

(Possible) upcoming features

* switches so you can run `kontrola -d` to do discovery, instead of setting the variable and running it
* find a javascript plugin to allow for searching of found hostnames
* provide an easy to parse csv output file, alongside the html output
* generate a PDF report with red/yellow/green icons showing what is due/expired
* email alerts, or at least have an email option `kontrola -e` to have the report emailed (again, PDF would be better for this than the html out)

#### As always, pull requests welcome!

## Acknoldegements

Like most (all?) good software, `kontrola` builds off of other excellent open source projects. At first I was using scripts I found on GitHub, that were excellent, but didn't do all of what I wanted. I integrated some ideas from the following projects. If `kontrola` doesn't do what you need, look at these as options

* [ssl-cert-check](https://github.com/Matty9191/ssl-cert-check)
* [checkssl](https://github.com/srvrco/checkssl)
* [go-check-certs](https://github.com/timewasted/go-check-certs)

Other outstanding open source projects used to build, presesnt, and search the reports

* [nmap](https://nmap.org/) a security scanner used to discover live hosts and query network ports
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) a front-end component library that is used to build the html reports
* [Tipue Search](http://www.tipue.com/search/) a jQuery-based site search plugin for the genearted html reports
